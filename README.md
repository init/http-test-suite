Web server test suite
=====================

Implement a Web server in the programming language of your choice. Libraries for helping manage TCP socket connections *may* be used (libevent allowed). Libraries that implement any part of HTTP or multiprocessing model *must not* be used.

## Requirements ##

* Respond to `GET` with status code in `{200,404}`
* Respond to `HEAD` with status code in `{200,404}`
* Respond to all other request methods with status code `405`
* Directory index file name `index.html`
* Respond to requests for `/<file>.html` with the contents of `DOCUMENT_ROOT/<file>.html`
* Requests for `/<directory>/` should be interpreted as requests for `DOCUMENT_ROOT/<directory>/index.html`
* Respond with the following header fields for all requests:
  * `Server`
  * `Date`
  * `Connection`
* Respond with the following additional header fields for all `200` responses to `GET` and `HEAD` requests:
  * `Content-Length`
  * `Content-Type`
* Respond with correct `Content-Type` for `.html, .css, js, jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .swf`
* Respond to percent-encoding URLs
* Correctly serve a 2GB+ files
* No security vulnerabilities

## Testing environment ##

* Put `Dockerfile` to web server repository root
* Prepare docker container to run tests:
  * Read config file `/etc/httpd.conf`
  * Expose port 80

Config file spec:
```
listen 80         # port number
cpu_limit 4       # maximum CPU count to use (for non-blocking servers)
thread_limit 256  # maximum simultaneous connections (for blocking servers)
document_root /var/www/html
```

Run tests:
```
git clone https://github.com/init/http-test-suite.git
cd http-test-suite

docker build -t bykov-httpd https://github.com/init/httpd.git
docker run -p 80:80 -v /etc/httpd.conf:/etc/httpd.conf:ro -v /var/www/http-test-suite:/var/www/http-test-suite:ro --name bykov-httpd -t bykov-httpd

./httptest.py
```

## Success criteria ##

* Must pass test suite
* Must pass load test
* Must use all CPUs
* Perfomance must inrease with increasing number of CPUs
* Perfomance must be comparable with nginx (same order of magnitude)
* No errors allowed
